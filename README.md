# Slowutils

This is a collection of utilities that no one should ever use.
They aren't slow in and of themselves, they're just designed to slow you down.

## Utils

### sl

This is a rusty rewrite of the classic `sl` command. It's a train that runs across your terminal.

### slowcat

This is a slow version of the `cat` command. It reads the file character by character and prints it to the terminal.

### dokcer

This is a typo of the `docker` command. It 'containerises' the application.

### gti

This is a typo of the `git` command. It prints a gti driving across the screen.
